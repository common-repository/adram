The simplest way to protect your ad revenue with AdRam
 
== Description ==

AdRam is an automated revenue protection service.

We hunt down people using ad-blocking software and do with them what you say.

AdRam can just recover blocked ad or can use more complex monetization payloads.
 
== Installation ==
1. Sign up
AdRam does not set limits on traffic or revenue.

Join us, get a code, deploy it.

2. Setup
Settings of AdRam are pretty simple but wide. You can just choose a payload and voila, it works.

Experienced users can setup postbacks, analytics and custom payloads.

3. That's all!
After setup, you'll get cosy dashboard, detailed statistics, affable support and automated payments on your wallet twice per moth.
